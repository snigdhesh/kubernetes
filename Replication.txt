Architecture:
====================
- kubernets have Clusters;
- Clusters have Nodes;
- Nodes have Pods;
- Pods have Containers;

kubernetes > Clusters> Nodes >  Pods >  containers

Controllers:
=============
- Controllers are brain behind kubernetes.
- Controllers are the processes, that monitor kubernetes objects and respoond accordingly.

Example: Replication Controller.
- Replication controller can bring a new pod, when current pod crashes. - Single pod case.
- Replication controllers allows us to run multilpe instances of single pod on kubernetes cluster.
- This provides "High Availability", when one "pod" crashes, another "pod" can serve the request.
- This also provides "Load Balancing", when traffic increases, additional pod is deployed to service the traffic. In other words to balance the load.
- When traffic increases even more, more pods are deployed across multiple nodes.

Replication Controller vs Replica Set.
======================================
Replication controller - Old technology
Replica set - new technology (recommended)
