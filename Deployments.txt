Deployment: It's a kubernetes object (like POD, REPLICASET ..) which comes higher in the hierarchy
- It allows us to do following
    -Rolling updates: Restarting production apps one by one (when new feature is deployed), is called rolling updates.
    -Rollback

How to deploy your app to production?
We make use of definition file.

How to use different strategy types?
use "kubectl describe deployment <deployment name>" to know strategy type.
- If "Recreate" strategy is used, all existing instaces of a pod will shutdown and new instances of pod will start.
- If "RollingUpdate" strategy, it goes one by one. One instance shuts down and new instace starts. This happens for all instance one by one. (This is recommended and default to avoid downtime in production)
