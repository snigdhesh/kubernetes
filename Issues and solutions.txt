How service works?
Port forwarding happens like shown below.
    Localhost > Node > service > pod (target)

Issues and solutions:
- We cannot access "minikube" node from localhost, while minikube is installed on docker.
- Which means localhost cannot talk to docker container, without port forwarding.
- Minikube is public image, and port is not exposed.
- Work around for this is to do port forwarding on service directly. (Instead of sending request to Node from localhost, we send request to service for testing purposes) 
  Example:  kubectl port-forward service/myapp-service 8082:80
                    #Where 8082=localhost; 
                    #80=port of myapp-service.
- Hence, service just blindly forwards all requests coming to it, to POD.
	
Example:
Approach1 [Has limitation with docker]: localhost > Node > Service > POD (Target)
Approach2 [Work around for above limitation, just to test service]: localhost > Service > POD (Target)
